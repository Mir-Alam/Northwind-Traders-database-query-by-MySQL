# Northwind Traders Dataset Analysis

This repository contains the documentation, **SQL queries**, and **code** for a comprehensive analysis of the **Northwind Traders** dataset. Northwind Traders is a company that imports and exports specialty foods from around the world. This project aims to provide valuable insights into various aspects of the business, including:

- Customers from specific countries or cities
- Product prices and price trends
- Orders by date and the largest product price
- Detailed analysis of the **Northwind Traders'** business data, including **customers**, **orders**, **inventory**, **purchasing**, **suppliers**, **shipping**, and **employees**

The **Northwind** dataset is an excellent resource for simulating small business **ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)** systems and business analysis.

## Project Overview

In this project, we explored the Northwind Traders dataset using **MySQL** to execute various SQL queries that analyze the business's operations across multiple aspects. By querying data from different tables (such as `Customers`, `Orders`, `Products`, `Suppliers`, etc.), we were able to derive insights that could help business decision-making.

### Key Insights Explored:
- **Customers by Country or City**: Identifying customers from specific locations.
- **Product Price Analysis**: Analyzing product prices and trends.
- **Order Date and Quantity Trends**: Exploring the relationship between order dates, quantities, and products.
- **Highest Priced Products**: Identifying the highest-priced products in the inventory.

## Tools and Technologies Used:
- **MySQL**: Used for querying and analyzing data from the Northwind Traders database.
- **SQL Queries**: Various SQL queries were written to extract insights from the dataset, covering everything from customer demographics to product pricing and orders.
- **Markdown**: Documentation and project details.

## SQL Queries and Analysis

### 1. Customers from Specific Countries or Cities
A query was created to list all customers from a particular country or city:
```sql
SELECT*
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Germany' AND City = 'Berlin';
###  -- Retrieve all columns from the "Customers" table where the "Country" is 'UK' or "City" is 'London', ordered by descending "CustomerName".
Select*
from Customers
Where Country='UK'or City='London'
order by customername DESC;

### 2. Product Price Analysis
This query returns products sorted by their price:
Retrieve all columns from the "Products" table where the "CategoryID" is 1 or 2, ordered by ascending "ProductName".
SELECT *
FROM Products
WHERE CategoryID IN (1,2)
order by ProductName ASC;

### 3. Customers by Contact person
select customername as customer,contactname as 'contact person'
from customers;

### 4. Highest Priced Product
To find the highest-priced product in the inventory:
SELECT ProductName, Price
FROM Products
ORDER BY Price DESC
LIMIT 1;

###Visualizations

Here are a few visualizations and insights created as part of this analysis:

1. Customers by Country and City
A visual representation of customer distribution by country and city can be useful for identifying regions with the most business activity.

2. Product Price Analysis
A chart of the product prices, sorted from highest to lowest, helps visualize which products are more expensive in the inventory.

3. Highest Priced Product
Hereâ€™s a table showing the most expensive product in the inventory.
